# Analyzing Learning Engagement System using AI-Based Real-Time Emotion and Behavior Detection System and Interactive Feedback Collection in K–12 STEAM Classrooms

This project aims to design and develop an AI-powered system that analyzes real-time classroom video to assess students’ engagement levels through facial expression, emotion, and behavioral analysis in the K-12 STEM classroom. The system automatically records attendance, detects emotional states, and estimates attention indices. A web-based dashboard visualizes engagement data for teachers, enabling adaptive teaching interventions and post-class analytics. The project will evaluate model performance (accuracy, latency) and user acceptance among educators, while ensuring ethical data collection and privacy compliance.
